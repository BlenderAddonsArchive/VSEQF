# VSE Quick Functions Addon For Blender

This script is designed to make Blender's VSE easier to use by implementing features often found in other video editors, or features that I find useful as a video editor.


## QuickFades
Enables one-click adding or changing a fade-in or fade-out.  
Also enables one-click crossfading between multiple strips.

Can be found in the sequence editor properties panel, or by pressing the 'f' key over the sequencer.  
Detected fades will also be shown on the active strip in the timeline, or in the edit strip properties panel.  Fades will be automatically moved if the edges of the strip are changed.
If context menus are enabled, fades can be set by right clicking on the edges of a strip.  

The 'QuickFades' panel provides buttons for setting and removing fades.

* __Fade Length__

   The target length for fade editing or creating.  
   This can be set to 0 to remove a fade.

* __Set Fadein/Set Fadeout__

   Allows easy adding and changing of fade in/out.  The script will check the curve for any fades already applied to the sequence (either manually or by the script), and edit them if found.  
   These buttons can apply the same fade to multiple selected sequences at once.

* __Clear Fades__

   Remove fades on all selected strips.

* __Transition Type__

   Selects the type of transition for adding with the following buttons.

* __Crossfade Prev/Next Sequence__

   Allows easy adding of transitions between sequences.  This will simply find the closest sequence to the active sequence, and add a transition between them.

* __Smart Cross to Prev/Next__

   Adjust the length of the active sequence and the next sequence to create a transition of the target fade length.  
   This will also attempt to avoid extending the sequences past their end points if possible.


## QuickSnaps
A menu for extra cursor and strip snapping functions.

Can be found in the sequence editor 'Strip' menu, or by pressing the 's' key over the sequencer.  
If context menu is enabled, some snaps will be found on right clicking the cursor, and some while right clicking strips.

* __Cursor To Nearest Second__

   Will round the cursor position to the nearest second, based on framerate.

* __Jump To Previous/Next Sequence__

   Snap the cursor to the previous or next sequence in the timeline.

* __Cursor To Beginning/End Of Active__

   Will move the cursor to the beginning or end of the active sequence.

* __Selected To Cursor__

   Snaps the beginning of selected strips to the cursor.  This is the same as the 'shift-s' shortcut in the VSE.

* __Selected Beginning/End To Cursor__

   Moves all selected sequences so their beginning/end is at the cursor.

* __Selected To Previous/Next Sequence__

   Detects the previous or next sequence in the timeline from the active sequence, and moves the active sequence so it's beginning or end matches the other sequence's end or beginning.


## QuickZooms
A menu with zoom shortcuts.

Can be found in the sequence editor 'View' menu, or by pressing the 'z' key over the sequencer.  
If context menus are enabled, can be found by right clicking in an open area.

* __Zoom All Strips__

   Zooms the sequencer out to show all sequences.

* __Zoom To Timeline__

   Zooms the sequencer to the timeline start and end.

* __Zoom Selected__

   Zooms the sequencer to show the currently selected sequence(s).

* __Zoom Cursor__

   Zooms the sequencer to an amount of frames around the cursor.

* __Size__

   How many frames should be shown by using Zoom Cursor. Changing this value will automatically activate Zoom Cursor.

* __Save Current Zoom__

   Saves the current zoom level and view position in the presets menu.

* __Zoom Presets__

   Submenu containing saved presets. Click the 'X' next to each preset to remove it, or click 'Clear All' to erase all presets.

* __Zoom (Time Lengths)__

   Several preset zoom values for convenience.


## QuickParents
This implements a parenting system for sequences, any children of a moved or cut sequence will have the same operations performed on them.  
If the sequence is cut, any children under the cursor will be cut as well, and the script will duplicate parent/child relationships to the cut sequences.  
If the parent sequence is resized and a child sequences have the same endpoints, they will be resized as well.


Can be found in the sequence editor properties panel under "Edit Strip", or by pressing the 'Ctrl-p' key over the sequencer.  
If context menus are enabled, the QuickParents popup menu will be shown when right clicking a sequence as well.  
Children or Parents of selected sequence will be shown in these places.

Parenting relationships are show in the timeline view for the active sequence, a light line indicates children of the active sequence, a dark line indicates a parent of the active sequence.

* __Select Children or Parent (Small Selection Button)__

   Selects any related sequences to the current sequence.  
   Also can be accomplished with the shortcut 'Shift-p'.

* __Clear Children or Parent (Small X Button)__

   Removes relationships from selected sequence.

* __Set Active As Parent__

   If multiple sequences are selected, this will set selected sequences as children of the active (last selected) sequence.

* __Cut/Move Sequence Children__

   Enables parenting operations on child sequences.

* __Auto-Select Children__

   When a parent sequence is selected, child sequences will be selected as well.

* __Auto-Delete Children__

   When a parent sequence is deleted, all children will be deleted as well.

These settings can also be found in the Quick Functions Settings menu.
